Description of the problem:

Worksheet size is only 2000x2000 pixels. Downloading the files for the new version of JDigitalSimulator to change the value from the code directly
and then running the program in IDE works. Problem is that the new 2.2.0 version can't seem to be able to open 1.1.6 version files.
One option would be decompiling the 1.1.6 version, editing the values for the worksheet size and then running that in IDE, but sadly it
will not recompile because of some kind of error, maybe related to different Java versions.

I have put the 1.1.6 version of the Simulator in the 'jdigitalsimulator' directory, just like out professor issued it to us. I have also put the CPU
files in the 'project' dir.
